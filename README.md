*Diversity Techniques for riverside Wireless Sensor Nodes over Software Defined Radios*

**Project Description** 

This project will investigate the effectiveness of multiple antennas on wireless sensor nodes to improve radiofrequency reliability. Different diversity techniques will be investigated, and a suggestion as to which is the most suitable will be made. During the project, the student will model and measure a multiple input single output system. Firstly in a lab and secondly outdoors. The platform used will be software defined radios. 

**Project Aim** 

 To measure the effectiveness of using multiple antennas on sensor nodes close to, and upon water using software defined radios.â€¯  
 
 *Current Progress*
- CW Rx Target and Host
- FM audio Tx Target (SISO)
- FM audio Rx Target and Host (SISO - still missing SIMO implementation)
- FM audio Rx Target and Host SIMO
- LoRa Rx on Target and Host with fosphor (waterfall)
- LoRa Tx on Target using Host generated IQ
- Arduino code for LoRa32 v2 Tx and RX
- Created three antenna mounts to test spatial diversity

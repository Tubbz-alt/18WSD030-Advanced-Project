*Diversity Techniques for riverside Wireless Sensor Nodes over Software Defined Radios*

**Project Description** 

This project will investigate the effectiveness of multiple antennas on wireless sensor nodes to improve radiofrequency reliability. Different diversity techniques will be investigated, and a suggestion as to which is the most suitable will be made. During the project, the student will model and measure a multiple input single output system. Firstly in a lab and secondly outdoors. The platform used will be software defined radios. 

**Project Aim** 

 To measure the effectiveness of using multiple antennas on sensor nodes close to, and upon water using software defined radios.
 
 *Project Progress*
1. Carrier Wave detection Rx Target with Host interface

FM SISO 
 1. FM audio Tx Target (SISO)
 2. FM audio Rx Target and Host
 
FM SIMO 
 1. FM audio Rx Target and Host SIMO
 
LoRa (beyond project aim - futher progress) 
 1. LoRa Rx on Target and Host with fosphor (waterfall)
 2. LoRa Tx on Target using Host generated IQ
 3. Arduino code for LoRa32 v2 Tx and RX
 4. LoRa Tx and Rx now works for targets and host - decoding not always succesful
 
Experimental set up
1. Created three antenna mounts to test spatial and polirisation diversity
2. Data collected has also been included for completion
